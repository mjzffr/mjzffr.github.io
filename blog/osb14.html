    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Open Source Bridge 2014 was my first conference experience in about 5 years and my first non-academic conference. It had a great mix of talks and was thoughtfully organized and super friendly. I learned about Firefox quality assurance, communication strategies, remote work, discrimination in the tech industry and being a better human. That mix could have been totally different though: during almost every session, there were 3-4 interesting talks competing for my attention, which is a good&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>Attendees were welcome to help out with conference logistics and encouraged to organize spontaneous, open meetings. For example, I spent a couple of hours volunteering as session chair, which amounts to helping each speaker set up for their talk, introducing them and giving them timing&nbsp;cues. </p>
<p>Liz and I also set up a table at the conference Hacker Lounge to <a href="./one-and-done-osbrige.html">introduce potential contributors to Firefox quality assurance and One and Done</a>. We ended up supporting four people as they each set up a development environment for our project. As expected, each participant ran into snags along the way with things like database configuration so it was good to work on this in a&nbsp;group. </p>
<p>It felt awesome to share my recent experience and speed up their setup process. I think the fact that One and Done is my first Django project helped a lot: when someone is new to a project, having expert mentors is great but in many cases it&#8217;s much easier to pose questions and relate to someone who is just a bit less of a beginner than you&nbsp;are. </p>
<p>That particular Hacker Lounge session got me thinking about how easy it is for potential <span class="caps">FOSS</span> contributors to get discouraged by setup alone. A good readme is priceless! The <a href="https://github.com/mjzffr/oneanddone/blob/master/README.md">One and Done readme</a> is quite detailed and helpful, but we will likely add a setup guide or dev <span class="caps">FAQ</span> to the projet wiki for additional support. It&#8217;s silly for someone to miss out on contributing just because they get mysterious errors while installing&nbsp;mysql! </p>
<h1>Firefox Quality&nbsp;Assurance</h1>
<p>This conference happened to be an opportunity for me to work and talk in person with Liz for the first time during my <span class="caps">OPW</span> internship. In addition to discussing additions to One and Done, Liz gave me a nice overview of how Firefox features and bug fixes get tested and gradually make their way through a series of release channels: from Nightly, to Aurora, then Beta, then a real release. We looked through this <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases/Firefox_31/Test_Plan">Firefox 31 Test Plan</a> and talked about the supporting tools used by the <span class="caps">QA</span>&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>Many of these tools are actually developed by Mozilla and there was a really nice talk at this year&#8217;s Open Source Bridge about one such tool, Socorro, which is used for <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1319">Firefox crash reporting and analysis</a>. Fun&nbsp;facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you go to <code>about:crashes</code> in Firefox, you can easily access the <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/">crash reports</a> you&#8217;ve submitted and see whether anyone is working on the associated&nbsp;bug(s).</li>
<li>Socorro stores about 3 months worth of crash reports (3-5 million crashes per day!) and those crashes are initially sent to file system storage rather  than a database. Why? A file system has better up-time than a&nbsp;database.</li>
<li>To access any particular crash quickly on that file system, a <a href="http://www.twobraids.com/2012/12/socorro-file-system-storage.html">radix storage scheme</a> is implemented with <strong>symbolic links</strong>. Cool. (You can&#8217;t just store thousands of files in one directory &#8212; file access would be ridiculously&nbsp;slow.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those points refer to just one component of Socorro &#8212; there&#8217;s all kinds of other neat stuff about&nbsp;it.</p>
<h1>Selected&nbsp;Talks</h1>
<p>Some of the talks I attended, like the one about Socorro, related quite closely to my current internship with&nbsp;Mozilla.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roan Kattouw showed us surprising and bizarre browser <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1247">rendering bugs</a> that he discovered while working on the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/VisualEditor">Visual Editor</a> for&nbsp;Wikimedia.</li>
<li>As it turns out, lots of people are as <a href="./remote-work.html">ambivalent about remote work</a> as I am, and we all flocked to two talks about how great it is to work on a distributed team. Handy tips for remote work: <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1244">overcommunicate</a> and <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1278">always assume good faith in text communication</a>. I feel&nbsp;hopeful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other talks helped me think about my future career path in the tech industry and the open source community. Unexpected bonus: many of these talks caused me to reflect about diversity and bias in our&nbsp;field.</p>
<ul>
<li>The way Julie Pagano described <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1185">impostor syndrome</a> really hit home: &#8220;People with impostor syndrome do not share knowledge, collaborate, help with <span class="caps">OSS</span>, apply for jobs. [They] start small, remain small, end up&nbsp;small.&#8221; </li>
<li>In a talk on <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1394">negotiation</a>, I learned how important it is to practice silence and pause: if you don&#8217;t feel informed enough to make a decision, focus on getting your questions answered. It sounds obvious but it&#8217;s hard to do in the moment! Similarly, another talk about <a href="http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1291">influence</a> described how to identify and respond to different communication styles and how to pay attention to the people around&nbsp;us.</li>
<li><a href="http://franceshocutt.com/2014/07/01/why-are-these-people-following-me-leadership-for-the-introverted-uncertain-and-astonished/">Frances Hocutt&#8217;s keynote</a> is filled with so much awesome. Go listen to it now. Here&#8217;s one of my favourite&nbsp;parts:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Leadership is learned, and learning requires vulnerability, and
vulnerability depends on the safety to be vulnerable. And our communities are
demonstrably unsafe. We are artificially limiting our pool of leaders. [&#8230;]
We create shame around ignorance. We devalue social and emotional
skills. [&#8230;] We devalue lived experience and natural variation, and 
in its place,
we raise up a false and impossible impartiality, which ends hurting
us all. We experience incompetent and unethical leadership, and
instead of learning to lead better we devalue the idea of&nbsp;leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>A Delighful Conference&nbsp;Experience</h1>
<ul>
<li>All the food was vegetarian, most of it was vegan. I eat meat but I didn&#8217;t miss it at all. It somehow added to the nice atmosphere that everyone could eat&nbsp;everything. </li>
<li>The attendee badges were actually booklets that contained the conference schedule and the code of conduct. One&#8217;s name appears on each side of the booklet, so no problem with flipped badges. The lanyards for the badges were colour-coded so you can easily tell who is ok with being photographed and who is&nbsp;not. </li>
<li>There was a quiet room! So nice for overwhelmed introverts like me. Being around people is exhausting.&nbsp;:)</li>
</ul>
<p>The way the conference was organized was considerate, inclusive and thoughtful. I hope to go back in future&nbsp;years. </p>
