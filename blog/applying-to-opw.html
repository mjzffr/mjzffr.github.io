    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I just started an internship with Mozilla&#8217;s <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/">Quality Assurance</a> team as part of the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://gnome.org/opw/">Outreach Program for Women</a> (<span class="caps">OPW</span>), but I almost didn&#8217;t even apply! In fact, I had decided <em>not</em> to apply for silly reasons, and then a week before the <em>extended</em> deadline I abruptly changed my mind &#8212; after some encouragement from the wonderful people at my <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> batch. (As it happens, I almost didn&#8217;t apply to Hacker School either. This is a&nbsp;pattern.)</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m very pleased that I did apply in the end, not just because I was ultimately selected for an internship but because the process itself was incredibly instructive. By the time I submitted my application, I felt like I could start contributing to Mozilla on my own regardless of whether I got an&nbsp;internship. </p>
<p>Overcoming initial barriers is built into the <span class="caps">OPW</span> application process: I interacted with people on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and it was scary but productive and good; I posted to project mailing lists and it was scary but productive and good; I added information to bugs in Bugzilla, and it was scary but productive and good. You get the idea&#8230; I made mistakes sometimes, but I fixed them and nothing terrible happened and no one seemed to hate&nbsp;me.</p>
<h1>Context</h1>
<p><em>Wait, what&#8217;s this Outreach Program for Women?</em> The <span class="caps">GNOME</span> Foundation and many others want more people who identify as women or genderqueer to be involved in contributions to free and open source software (<span class="caps">FOSS</span>). Awesome! So one thing <span class="caps">GNOME</span> does is organize payed internships with various <span class="caps">FOSS</span> organizations especially for this category of humans. To apply, the human in question must learn about the participating organizations and their available projects, choose one or more projects of interest, <em>interact with current contributors</em> and <em>contribute something themselves</em>. Depending on the project, one&#8217;s application process might take a few weeks. The project descriptions indicate how you can get started with contributing, and you need to communicate with the project mentor about what you might work on during the&nbsp;application.</p>
<h1>My Application&nbsp;Experience</h1>
<p>I started working on my application a week before the deadline, and I spent 7 full days on my application, setting aside my other Hacker School projects during that time. By the deadline, I wasn&#8217;t sure my contribution was substantial enough but I submitted what I had anyway. That being said, the process seems relatively flexible and varies across organizations. I could have expanded my contributions after the application deadline &#8212; the reason I didn&#8217;t boils down to other time constraints on my&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>My application was for the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/GNOME_Outreach_Summer2014#Mozilla_Bug_Wrangler_.28Desktop_QA.29">Bug Wrangler</a> internship with Mozilla. When I contacted the designated mentor, Liz (<a href="https://twitter.com/lizhenry">@lhenry</a>), I explained that I&#8217;m more interested in the software development aspects of the position, and she suggested some more specific projects based on&nbsp;that. </p>
<p>At that point, I only had a few days left to make a contribution to the project in question, so I focused on gaining experience with tasks related to the bug life-cycle at Mozilla: reproducing and adding information to unconfirmed bugs in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>, testing the latest nightly build of Firefox to verify that bugs have been fixed, and so on. I also set up the development environment for a Django project I might work on during the internship. I managed to build the project and wanted to contribute something to it as part of my application, but I felt that I didn&#8217;t have enough time to communicate with the project team before the application deadline. (I regret this; maybe I should have just jumped&nbsp;in.)</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how I spent my time during the application process, <strong>aside from making my contributions and writing the application itself</strong>. These small tasks add up, both in terms of time and in terms of making future contributions&nbsp;easier. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading</strong>, so much panic and reading. Things I read or skimmed: project descriptions, contributor/tool guides/documentation, Bugzilla terminology and Firefox/Mozilla components, bug reports, pull request discussions on Github, mailing-list archives, press releases, blog posts by past interns, project meeting minutes, <span class="caps">IRC</span> etiquette,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li><strong>Setup and configuration</strong>: registration with things like Bugzilla, <span class="caps">IRC</span>, Mozillians; choosing and setting up an <span class="caps">IRC</span> client; configuring a testing environment for&nbsp;Firefox.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> : emailing and chatting with the project mentor about available projects, my interests, and the application process; asking questions on <span class="caps">IRC</span> when I run into issues; I participated in a small video meeting during a Mozilla Test Day; introduced myself and asked for help on a couple of mailing&nbsp;lists.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong> in preparation for more contributions: trying out the specific tools I might work on to gain a user perspective; reading about Django and building one of Mozilla&#8217;s Django projects; setting up a database for&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>My top tips for&nbsp;applying: </p>
<ol>
<li>Communicate a lot. (I think that&#8217;s almost the whole&nbsp;point.)</li>
<li>Keep a brief, informal log of what you do as you do it. The log is handy for when you have questions later, when you come back to the project after a few weeks away, when you&#8217;re writing your application, and so&nbsp;on.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume there is some universally accepted, perfect approach to your task. There are grey areas. Example: how to classify a particular Firefox bug. So, do ask questions! Remember that &#8220;experts&#8221; ask questions, too, and interesting discussion among several helpful people many ensue, which is really cool.&nbsp;:)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it again: the <span class="caps">OPW</span> internship application process is a great learning experience. Although I already knew a good amount about <span class="caps">FOSS</span> before I got started, I now have a much better sense for how a giant, open source project like Firefox grows and stays&nbsp;healthy. </p>
<p>Do apply! Encourage others to&nbsp;apply! </p>
