Some are Mozilla employees or maybe contractors, some are interns like me, some might be volunteers. The key point is that it&amp;#8217;s not just me with my mentor, focused on our own area: I need to find my voice in this in group of people, and that&amp;#8217;s where working remotely gets&amp;nbsp;hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very initial, tentative impressions of full-time, remote work is that it&amp;#8217;s not bad, but it takes more getting used to than I expected. I&amp;#8217;ve worked from home a lot, as a developer and as a teacher, but I&amp;#8217;ve only ever collaborated on projects with people that I spend time with &amp;#8220;at the office&amp;#8221; or that I meet with in person from time to time. My current full-time, remote status makes me realize that chatting and getting to know coworkers between bursts of productivity is pretty valuable! Crazy!
