Frydrychowicz</name></author><id>tag:www.erranderr.com,2014-05-13:blog/applying-to-opw.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just started an internship with Mozilla&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/"&gt;Quality Assurance&lt;/a&gt; team as part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNOME&lt;/span&gt; Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://gnome.org/opw/"&gt;Outreach Program for Women&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPW&lt;/span&gt;), but I almost didn&amp;#8217;t even apply! In fact, I had decided &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to apply for silly reasons, and then a week before the &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; deadline I abruptly changed my mind &amp;#8212; after some encouragement from the wonderful people at my &lt;a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/"&gt;Hacker School&lt;/a&gt; batch. (As it happens, I almost didn&amp;#8217;t apply to Hacker School either. This is a&amp;nbsp;pattern.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;#8217;m very pleased that I did apply in the end, not just because I was ultimately selected for an internship but because the process itself was incredibly instructive. By the time I submitted my application, I felt like I could start contributing to Mozilla on my own regardless of whether I got an&amp;nbsp;internship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming initial barriers is built into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPW&lt;/span&gt; application process: I interacted with people on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; and it was scary but productive and good; I posted to project mailing lists and it was scary but productive and good; I added information to bugs in Bugzilla, and it was scary but productive and good. You get the idea&amp;#8230; I made mistakes sometimes, but I fixed them and nothing terrible happened and no one seemed to hate&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait, what&amp;#8217;s this Outreach Program for Women?&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNOME&lt;/span&gt; Foundation and many others want more people who identify as women or genderqueer to be involved in contributions to free and open source software (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSS&lt;/span&gt;). Awesome! So one thing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNOME&lt;/span&gt; does is organize payed internships with various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSS&lt;/span&gt; organizations especially for this category of humans. To apply, the human in question must learn about the participating organizations and their available projects, choose one or more projects of interest, &lt;em&gt;interact with current contributors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;contribute something themselves&lt;/em&gt;. Depending on the project, one&amp;#8217;s application process might take a few weeks. The project descriptions indicate how you can get started with contributing, and you need to communicate with the project mentor about what you might work on during the&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Application&amp;nbsp;Experience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on my application a week before the deadline, and I spent 7 full days on my application, setting aside my other Hacker School projects during that time. By the deadline, I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure my contribution was substantial enough but I submitted what I had anyway. That being said, the process seems relatively flexible and varies across organizations. I could have expanded my contributions after the application deadline &amp;#8212; the reason I didn&amp;#8217;t boils down to other time constraints on my&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My application was for the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/GNOME_Outreach_Summer2014#Mozilla_Bug_Wrangler_.28Desktop_QA.29"&gt;Bug Wrangler&lt;/a&gt; internship with Mozilla. When I contacted the designated mentor, Liz (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizhenry"&gt;@lhenry&lt;/a&gt;), I explained that I&amp;#8217;m more interested in the software development aspects of the position, and she suggested some more specific projects based on&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I only had a few days left to make a contribution to the project in question, so I focused on gaining experience with tasks related to the bug life-cycle at Mozilla: reproducing and adding information to unconfirmed bugs in &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/"&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;, testing the latest nightly build of Firefox to verify that bugs have been fixed, and so on. I also set up the development environment for a Django project I might work on during the internship. I managed to build the project and wanted to contribute something to it as part of my application, but I felt that I didn&amp;#8217;t have enough time to communicate with the project team before the application deadline. (I regret this; maybe I should have just jumped&amp;nbsp;in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how I spent my time during the application process, &lt;strong&gt;aside from making my contributions and writing the application itself&lt;/strong&gt;. These small tasks add up, both in terms of time and in terms of making future contributions&amp;nbsp;easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;, so much panic and reading. Things I read or skimmed: project descriptions, contributor/tool guides/documentation, Bugzilla terminology and Firefox/Mozilla components, bug reports, pull request discussions on Github, mailing-list archives, press releases, blog posts by past interns, project meeting minutes, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; etiquette,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup and configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: registration with things like Bugzilla, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;, Mozillians; choosing and setting up an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; client; configuring a testing environment for&amp;nbsp;Firefox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt; : emailing and chatting with the project mentor about available projects, my interests, and the application process; asking questions on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; when I run into issues; I participated in a small video meeting during a Mozilla Test Day; introduced myself and asked for help on a couple of mailing&amp;nbsp;lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; in preparation for more contributions: trying out the specific tools I might work on to gain a user perspective; reading about Django and building one of Mozilla&amp;#8217;s Django projects; setting up a database for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top tips for&amp;nbsp;applying: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate a lot. (I think that&amp;#8217;s almost the whole&amp;nbsp;point.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a brief, informal log of what you do as you do it. The log is handy for when you have questions later, when you come back to the project after a few weeks away, when you&amp;#8217;re writing your application, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t assume there is some universally accepted, perfect approach to your task. There are grey areas. Example: how to classify a particular Firefox bug. So, do ask questions! Remember that &amp;#8220;experts&amp;#8221; ask questions, too, and interesting discussion among several helpful people many ensue, which is really cool.&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll say it again: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPW&lt;/span&gt; internship application process is a great learning experience. Although I already knew a good amount about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSS&lt;/span&gt; before I got started, I now have a much better sense for how a giant, open source project like Firefox grows and stays&amp;nbsp;healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do apply! Encourage others to&amp;nbsp;apply! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="mozilla"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="opw"></category><category term="foss"></category></entry></feed>
