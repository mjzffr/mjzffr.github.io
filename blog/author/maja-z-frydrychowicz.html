                    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="http://majazf.ca/blog/osb14.html">Open Source Bridge 2014</a></h1>
                    <p>Open Source Bridge 2014 was my first conference experience in about 5 years and my first non-academic conference. It had a great mix of talks and was thoughtfully organized and super friendly. I learned about Firefox quality assurance, communication strategies, remote work, discrimination in the tech industry and being a better human. That mix could have been totally different though: during almost every session, there were 3-4 interesting talks competing for my attention.</p>
<p>Attendees were welcome to help out with conference logistics and encouraged to organize spontaneous, open meetings. For example, I spent a couple of hours volunteering as a session chair, which amounts to helping each speaker set up for their talk, introducing them and giving them timing cues. </p>
<p>Liz and I also set up a table at the conference Hacker Lounge to introduce potential contributors to Firefox quality assurance and One and Done. We ended up supporting four people as they each set up a development environment for One and Done. As expected, each participant ran into snags along the way with things like database configuration so it was good to work on this in a group. </p>
<p>I had encountered most of these setup issues myself before, so it felt awesome to share my experience and speed up their setup process. I think the fact that One and Done was my first Django experience helped a lot: when someone is new to a project, having expert mentors is great but in many cases it's much easier to pose questions and relate to someone who is just a bit less of a beginner than you are. </p>
<p>That particular Hacker Lounge session got me thinking about how easy it is for potential contributors to get discouraged by setup alone. A good readme is priceless! The One and Done readme is quite detailed and helpful, but based our experience at the Hacker Lounge, we will likely add a setup guide or dev FAQ to the projet wiki for additional support. It's silly for someone to miss out on contributing just because they're having trouble installing mysql! </p>
<h1>Selected Talks</h1>
<p>I ended up attending talks that showed off some interesting problems related to web browsers and the web in general as well as talks that helped me think about my career path.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pagano, quote about impostor syndome http://www.opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1185
"People with impostor syndrome do not share knowledge, collaborate, help with OSS, apply for jobs"</li>
<li>Socorro and browser bugs</li>
<li>Slytherin and negotionation</li>
<li>Programming Blog</li>
<li>Remote work</li>
<li>CLDR</li>
</ul>
<p>Feminism in general</p>
<p>Finally, not a talk, but I had an in-depth conversation with Liz about firefox releases.</p>
<h1>Lovely Conference Experience</h1>
<p>The way the conference was organized was considerate, inclusive and thoughtful. </p>
<ul>
<li>All the food was vegetarian, most of it was vegan. I eat meat but I didn't miss it at all. It somehow added to the nice atmosphere that everyone could eat everything. It was also a relief to have easy access to healthy snacks -- I think I would have been much more exhausted throughout the conference otherwise.</li>
<li>The badges were actually booklets that contained the conference schedule and the code of conduct. One's name appears on each side of the booklet, so no problem with flipped badges. The lanyards for the badges were colour-code so you can easily tell who is ok with being photographed and who is not. </li>
<li>There was a quiet room! So nice for overwhelmed introverts like me. Being around people is exhausting. :)</li>
